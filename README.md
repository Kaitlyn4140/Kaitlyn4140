I'm a **second year Software Engineering major at UCI.**  
I just recently switched over from the Informatics major.
At first, I originally chose Informatics because I was more interested in the design and front end side of things like the UI/UX.
However, as I was taking my first year programming intro courses, I realized that coding can be pretty fun too.
I chose to switch into Software Engineering because I thought it was a good middle ground between Informatics and Computer Science.
